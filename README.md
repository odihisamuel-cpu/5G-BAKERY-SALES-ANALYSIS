# 5G Bread Bakery Sales Data Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive sales data analysis for **5G Bread Bakery**, a small-to-medium scale bakery business. The analysis uses Python-based data analytics and visualization techniques to understand sales performance, customer demand patterns, and revenue contribution across different bakery products.

The project is designed as a **portfolio and academic-style data analysis**, suitable for GitHub presentation, academic reference, and freelance platforms such as Upwork.

## 2. Problem Statement

Small retail bakeries often struggle with:

* Identifying their best-selling products
* Understanding revenue contribution by product
* Tracking daily and monthly sales trends
* Making data-driven production and pricing decisions

Without proper data analysis, decisions are based on intuition rather than evidence, leading to inefficiency and lost revenue.

## 3. Objectives of the Study

The main objectives of this project are to:

* Analyze sales performance of different bakery products
* Identify products that generate the highest and lowest revenue
* Examine daily and monthly sales trends
* Visualize sales data for better business understanding
* Provide actionable business recommendations

---

## 4. Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is a **synthetic bakery sales dataset** created for analytical purposes.

### Key Variables:

* **Date**: Sales transaction date
* **Product**: Type of bakery product sold
* **Quantity Sold**: Number of units sold
* **Unit Price**: Price per unit of product
* **Total Revenue**: Quantity multiplied by unit price

The dataset is stored in CSV format and processed using Python.

## 5. Methodology

The analysis follows these steps:

1. **Data Importation** – Sales data loaded using Pandas
2. **Data Cleaning** – Date formatting and variable validation
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Summary statistics and grouping
4. **Data Visualization** – Graphical representation using Matplotlib
5. **Insight Extraction** – Interpretation of charts and patterns

## 6. Tools and Technologies

* **Python**: Core programming language
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis environment
* **GitHub**: Version control and project hosting

## 7. Data Analysis and Visualizations

### 7.1 Total Sales by Product

This bar chart compares total revenue generated by each bakery product. It highlights top-performing and low-performing items.

### 7.2 Daily Sales Trend

The line graph shows how total sales fluctuate across different days. It helps identify peak sales periods and slow days.

### 7.3 Revenue Contribution by Product (Pie Chart)

The pie chart illustrates the percentage contribution of each product to total revenue, providing insight into revenue concentration.

### 7.4 Monthly Sales Performance

This visualization shows aggregated monthly sales, allowing assessment of seasonality and overall business growth.

## 8. Key Findings

* **Croissant and Plantain Crunch Bread** are the highest revenue-generating products
* **Puff-Puff** contributes the least to total revenue
* Sales show noticeable variation across days, suggesting demand cycles
* Monthly sales remain relatively stable with mild fluctuations

---

## 9. Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

1. Increase production capacity for high-performing products
2. Bundle low-performing products with popular items
3. Introduce promotions on slow sales days
4. Use historical sales trends for inventory planning

---

## 10. Limitations of the Study

* Dataset is synthetic and may not capture real-world volatility
* No customer demographic data included
* External factors such as inflation and competition are not modeled

---

## 11. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **data analytics and visualization** can support business decision-making in small retail enterprises. Using Python, meaningful insights were extracted from raw sales data to guide strategic planning and operational efficiency.

The project serves as a strong foundation for real-world sales analysis, academic research, and professional data analytics portfolios.
